We love to see the community create and share new Jupyter Docker images.
We've put together this cookiecutter project to help you get started
defining, building, and sharing your Jupyter environments in Docker.

See the [Community Stacks page](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/stacks.html)
in the [Jupyter Docker Stacks documentation](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for step-by-step instructions.
